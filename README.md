# Twitter Clone Frontend

This repository contains a front-end Twitter clone app built using React and CSS. The app provides a simple user interface with a start page and a home page, mimicking the basic functionality of Twitter. Please note that this app does not have any backend functionality, so user sign-up, sign-in, and data persistence are not implemented.

## Features

- **Start Page:** The app begins with a start page where users are welcomed and prompted to sign in or sign up.

- **Home Page:** After clicking the "Sign In" button on the start page, users are directed to the home page. The home page showcases a simplified Twitter-like feed where users can imagine reading tweets.
